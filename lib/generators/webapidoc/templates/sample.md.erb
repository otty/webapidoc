====================

Paragraphs

This is just a regular paragraph. Now is the time for all good men to come to
the aid of [their country](http://www.google.de). Look the link!

Elements

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
dog's back.

Support for ERB

Table of contents generated via ERB:

<% @chapters.each_with_index do |chapter, idx| %>
<%= idx %>. [<%= chapter[:name] %>](/documentation/<%= chapter[:out] %>)
<% end %>

Some code
---------------------

This is just some code.

        [
          {
            "title": "apples",
            "count": [12000, 20000],
            "description": {"text": "...", "sensitive": false}
          },
          {
            "title": "oranges",
            "count": [17500, null],
            "description": {"text": "...", "sensitive": false}
          }
        ]

This is some `code` within a paragraph. More to come!
